## MVP
### At a minimum your e-shop website should have Three pages:

- Home Page
   - This will contain:
   - A Grid of products
   - Carousel of featured (or favourited) products
- Product Page (with id parameter) Similar to a product page on another site, allows you to add to cart and select product variants
   - All products should be stored in Firestore:
   - You should store the following information:
     1. quantity
     2. variants (could be colors, sizes, etc)
     3. price per unit
     4. name
     5. image url
     6. favourited or not (boolean) All data should be stored in Firestore and fetched by the frontend, there should be NO static product data in the react application
- Cart
  - A list of all products added to the user's cart and a total price
  - You should not be able to add more items than are in stock to the cart
  - You may want to adjust quantity of products from the    Cart page
  - You should be able to remove products from the cart

## PURPOSE
 - Purpose of project is to build an app that allows users to scroll through the products, view details of any particular product and be able to add the product to the shopping list

## Stack used:-
 - React JS
 - CSS
 - Firestore
 - React-router

## My struggle:-
 - I would rather say, this project was actually an opportunity to learn alot more about what React can offer to make life easy.

## Future Goals
 - I might like to add more products along with a search bar for the users to be able to type in the product they are looking for
